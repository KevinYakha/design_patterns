# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Repository**! This repository contains code examples, explanations, and best practices for implementing software design patterns. It is designed to help developers learn and apply these patterns to create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient code.

## Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software development. By understanding and implementing them, developers can improve the architecture and quality of their applications.

This repository focuses on the following design pattern categories:
- **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation.
- **Structural Patterns**: Concerned with class/object composition.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Address communication between objects.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
1. **Singleton** - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method** - Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
3. **Abstract Factory** - Provide an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder** - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.

### Structural Patterns
1. **Adapter** - Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
2. **Composite** - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
3. **Decorator** - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

### Behavioral Patterns
1. **Observer** - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, its dependents are notified.
2. **Strategy** - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
3. **Command** - Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Txpert/design_patterns.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the pattern you wish to explore, and review the slides file for details on the implementation and its use.

3. Run the example code provided to see the patterns in action.
